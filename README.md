# [xkcd-webapp](https://xkcd.ingo.au)

A web app for reading and saving xkcd comics. Very over-engineered for what it is, but it is very fast, and has some nice features.

## Tech stack
* React
* Next
* Tailwind
* shadcn/ui
* Convex

## Keyboard shortcuts
* `s` - to save the current comic
* `shift+s` - view saved comics
* `r` - random
* `t` - latest
* `g` - go to a specific comic by number (or can just start typing the number)
* `i` - info
* Arrows or HJKL - previous/next and scroll
